## Development Setup

### Ethereum

Local [Truffle installation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation) necessary. 
Note that there are some quirks with regards to node version, especially for the local test Ethereum network, (using LTS version from NVM works, e.g. node `v12.18.3`), so using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended.
